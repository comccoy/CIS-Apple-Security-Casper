# CIS-Apple-Security-Casper

Basic examples of scripts and EA's to implement the CIS Apple Security guidelines for macOS 10.12 only! (some changes between 10.12 and earlier versions).

Think of this as a reference implementation. There are plenty things in CIS that can be done more readily with configuration profiles, some things that are ... contradictory and others that may not even be relevant to your needs. I'm not convinced 100% compliance is the way to go and allow people to be able to work.

Not everything in CIS is implemented here. This is partly due to some standards being implemented by profiles and others being out of date and effectively deprecated.
